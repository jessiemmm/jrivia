## About

Jrivia is a trivia website made by Jared Rudnicki and Jessica Chin. It supports various users (registered users, moderators, and guests) and its main purpose is to be a fun website that allows people to create and answer trivia questions. New trivia questions can be generated both manually and automatically -- if the user is a moderator and the 'Generate' button is pressed, random trivia questions are added from an external API.
